I've created this Python Bot using the followint libraries:
- pyttsx3: pyttsx is a cross-platform text to speech library which is platform-independent. The major advantage of using this library for text-to-speech conversion is that it works offline.
- SpeechRecognition: This allows us to convert audio into text for further processing.
- pywhatkit: This is an easy-to-use library that will help us interact with the browser very easily.
- wikipedia: We'll use this to fetch a variety of information from the Wikipedia website.
- requests: This is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python that allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.

Using the following libraries I've made some methods that will make my bot able to tell me the weather, search for things on wikipedia, send emails, open applications from Windows and even tell me jokes and giving me advices.
